Roll for Retribution (name TBD) Design Document / idea notes

// TODO: abstract/cleanup the code for magnet.cs
// Player feels short. Should be looked into
// We should track the number of cube demons in the player's hand like an ammo counter
// TODO: Update the levitation ability UI to be more similar to splitgate's jetpack UI. (Make it so it only shows when using it, smaller, in center of screen, and a semi-circle

// TODO: Change colors of enemies to contrast with the terrain and skybox.

// TODO: Overhaul visuals for hand UI. Does not fit the game's color palette

2. Cubes and player need impact when hitting the ground.

Possible upgrades:
- Rock shoot speed
- Rock follow/attract speed
- More rocks
- Heavier cubes (cubes fall faster)

Look at BTD6 and Vampire survivors for upgrade and ability references/examples.

Smaller cubes are faster and easier to control. Maybe smaller is just a straight upgrade, OR you have two paths like bloons: smaller or larger cubes.

2x cubes take up the entire screen.

Bigger cubes tumble more like dice while smaller cubes bounce like bullets.
