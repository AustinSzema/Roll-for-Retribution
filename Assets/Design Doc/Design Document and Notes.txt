Frogun (name TBD) Design Document / idea notes


Use 1 and 2 to switch between the magnets 


Cubes and player need impact when hitting ground 

Trail renderers on the cubes 

Make the cubes dice 

Piano music 

Speed upgrades, base speed 20f


Possible upgrades:
- Move speed
- Rock shoot speed
- Rock follow/attract speed
- Bigger rocks
- More rocks 
- heavier cubes (cubes fall faster) (this may make the cubes look a lot less cool)

Possible abilities:
- Rock floating ability (magnet goes under player when pressing space)
- Double jump
- explosive rocks (rocks explode on impact)

Look at BTD6 and Vampire survivors for upgrade and ability references/examples


Smaller cubes are faster and easier to control

maybe smaller is just a straight upgrade, OR you have two paths like bloons: smaller or larger cubes

2x cubes take up the entire screen

bigger cubes tumble more like dice while smaller cubes bounce like bullets

what kinda vibe are we going for?

BUG: when the cubes are all collected in front of the player, they can block the player because the player is walking into them. Consider turning off the cubes' collider when in front of the player (this opens up a lot more problems)

trails look really cool but block most of the screen 




add blue sphere when cubes are being pulled in


make a state machine and booleans that updated scriptable object variables so any object can access when you are attracting or repelling


if you kill all the cows, none of them respawn. Also the killcounter keeps counting up for some reason??
