Roll for Retribution (name TBD) Design Document / idea notes

//TODO: Change the Game's title to properly reflect the current game.

// TODO: abstract/cleanup the code for magnet.cs

// TODO: Update the levitation ability UI to be more similar to splitgate's jetpack UI. (Make it so it only shows when using it, smaller, in center of screen, and a semi-circle

// TODO: Change colors of enemies to contrast with the terrain and skybox.

// TODO: Overhaul visuals for the UI. UI images need more texture and the colors do not fit the game's color palette or theme.

// TODO: The game is lacking in feedback.
// - Whenever anything collides with anything, there needs to be particles at the point of collision.
// - Enemy deaths are not as satisfying because there is not enough feedback when they are hit. Enemies should flash white when hit and have particles and other visuals to indicate that they took damage.

// The player feels short. The camera is low to the ground relative to the terrain. This isn't necessarily a problem but it makes the player feel small and weak when on the ground.
// We should track the number of cube demons in the player's hand like an ammo counter if needed for certain weapon types or abiltiies. For example, more cubes in hand means more powerful jump boost (flight ability).

Possible upgrades:
- Rock shoot speed
- Rock follow/attract speed
- More rocks
- Heavier cubes (cubes fall faster)

Look at BTD6 and Vampire survivors for upgrade and ability references/examples.

Smaller cubes are faster and easier to control. Maybe smaller is just a straight upgrade, OR you have two paths like bloons: smaller or larger cubes.

2x cubes take up the entire screen.

Bigger cubes tumble more like dice while smaller cubes bounce like bullets.
