3/8/2024 16:32:36,"Yes! I play from time to time, most recently played helldivers, CoD warzone, favorites are halo",Not many but i have played them,About 15-20 minutes,"I felt super powerful as I could one shot demons, it got a bit overwhelming with all the units spawning so quickly. felt like some spawned basically under me and i would just take damage without knowing where they come from","reading the text is a little difficult, ","felt good, simple",switching from push pull  to levitation is sometimes a little wonky,"when i first played it and i was trying to fight in the same spot, sometimes enemies ",The tutorial hovering text is a little difficult to see unless you stand in certain positions.
3/8/2024 16:36:38,I ONLY LIKED PLAYING BORDERLANDS FRANCHISE ,yes,15 mins,i was zoomin,yes,i was going zoom ,no,when i see a red dot spawn right behind me ,none
3/9/2024 22:55:29,yes. Doom games,some. devil daggers,20 mins,too powerful,tutorial was good.,good,Just the levitation ability. VERY jarring with the bugs. Can't hold momentum and takes you out of the moment,No,Everything was good. Didn't know about the slam ability until late. Don't know if I missed that part or if it isn't in the game except for controls
3/10/2024 22:26:29,"yes I play them often, my favorites are Call of Duty, Valorant, Overwatch ","Yes but only play them from time to time, my favorite is Vampire Survivor ",15 Minutes,Felt powerful however the demons obstruct the view too much when held in hand ,Do not need WASD tutorial ,I liked the controls would potentially like the smash button to be a keybind,No but maybe too much time spent in air without danger ,Only when on ground for small amount of time ,hud was good 
3/10/2024 22:31:42,I enjoy them but they aren't necessarily my go-to by any means.,"I like playing them, but feeling too overpowered for too long makes it feel like there's not enough of a challenge.",5-10 minutes,"While the number of enemies got high at some points, it always felt easy enough to eliminate most of them. The control over the demon projectiles was empowering, as was the ability to take out many in a single shot or slam.",The tutorial was very straight forward but directional movement wasn't necessary.,"The push and pull controls were simple, intuitive, and easy to use.","One thing that I wasn't totally thrilled with was that since flight was tied to pulling, I couldn't really spend much time seeing the projectiles from afar without them coming back to me due to being in flight.",The format didn't feel particularly dangerous. The movement speed was always enough to keep space between myself and the enemies when I occasionally ran out of flight time.,"It wasn't so much that anything felt obstructed, but I didn't really find myself looking at the mini-map at all. It may have been due to the fully open terrain but it didn't feel useful with the current layout just yet."
3/10/2024 22:32:05,I do not play a lot of first person shooters.,I have never played a bullet heaven game but they sound fun. ,25 minutes,I felt powerful. I felt a little overwhelmed at first but I got used to the mechanics quickly. Itâ€™s very satisfying.,The tutorial was clear but the slamming mechanic and objective were not included.,I found them to be intuitive. ,No,Slightly before I was used to the map.,There were times where the demons were blocking my view.
3/11/2024 15:04:00,"they are fun, but i dont play often","yes, i havent played often but ive played vampire survivors, holocure, and gensokyo surivivors a little bit and they are fun",~20 minutes,"the abilities felt smooth, just unmanaged, some cooldowns might make it feel better, I also recommend more fedback, maybe screenshake when a lot of demons hit the ground near you etc.",didnt mention slamming otherwise it made sense,"more feedback would be nice, it didnt feel like it had weight to it",n/a,when i wasn't in the air,"it wasnt obtrusive at all, maybe the levetation meter could be made smaller and closer/integrated with the crosshair so its easier to read, but it wasnt too hard to read anyways where it was"
